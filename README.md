**Author**: Adam Rachuba  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Architecture**: MVC (Model-View-Controller)  
**Language**: Java  
**Framework**: JavaFX  


## üìñ About the Project

**Chess Puzzle** is a JavaFX desktop application for solving chess puzzles, using a clean MVC architecture and external data from online API.

The application integrates with the [Lichess.org API](https://lichess.org/api), from which it fetches real chess puzzles. These puzzles are saved to a local **SQLite** database to allow offline access and faster puzzle loading.

The project was developed as part of a laboratory course at the **Military University of Technology (WAT)** and serves both as a practical exercise in software architecture and a functional chess training tool.
